# CarExhibition - Unity

This **CarExhibition Show** sample uses URP, Multiview environment, double resolution rendering, models from SketchFab licensed models, and a particle effect added to the scene to enhance the sense of space.

At the default view range, the frame rate can be stabilized around 120fps, requiring that the 120fps refresh mode is also enabled in Pico Lab
